#### Questions:

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I am the most interested in the speicific workings of methods used for causal discovery (creation of DAGs). While I am still interested in algorithmic approcaches, I am mostly interested in how it is possible to turn the problem of causal discovery into a continuous optimization problem.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like to look into the use of time-series data with continuious optimization methods for generating DAGs.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would have spent less time investigating papers and methods that are outdated (even by just a few years). At the time we were not aware that we were looking at papers that had since been built off of.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am also interested in exploring the idea of structure learning used to make DAGs to make MLP-esque graphs.
